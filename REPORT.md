# COSC 473 Assignment 1 Report - Mandelbrot Set Explorer

## How application works

### wasm-module

- Complex number calculations using the `num-complex` crate for mathematical operations
- Efficient pixel buffer generation with direct memory manipulation
- Multiple color scheme implementations using HSV to RGB conversion
- Comprehensive error handling and input validation
- WebAssembly bindings using `wasm-bindgen` for seamless JavaScript integration

#### frontend

The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, providing:

- Interactive controls for all visualization parameters
- Real-time updates with efficient state management
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Type-safe component architecture
- Canvas-based rendering with optimal performance

## Any challenges faced and approach to solving them

### 1. WebAssembly Performance Optimization

**Challenge**: Initial implementations showed performance bottlenecks when calculating large sets of points or handling high zoom levels.

**Solution**: 

- Implemented efficient memory management in Rust
- Optimized the pixel buffer generation algorithm
- Reduced data copying between Rust and JavaScript
- Utilized direct memory access where possible

### 2. Color Scheme Implementation

**Challenge**: Creating visually appealing and mathematically accurate color mappings that work across different iteration ranges.

**Solution**:

- Implemented a flexible HSV to RGB conversion system
- Created multiple artistic variations (Rainbow, Fire, Ocean, etc.)
- Added smooth color transitions between iteration bands
- Implemented dynamic color scaling based on zoom level

### 3. User Interface Responsiveness

**Challenge**: Maintaining a responsive UI during heavy computations.

**Solution**:

- Implemented efficient React state management
- Added loading states for computation-heavy operations
- Optimized render cycles to prevent UI blocking
- Used React's useCallback and useMemo for performance
