# Mandelbrot Set Explorer with Rust WebAssembly and React

This project demonstrates the power of Rust and WebAssembly by implementing a Mandelbrot set fractal generator. The core computation is performed in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly, and integrated with a React frontend for an interactive user experience.

## Features

- **Rust-powered Fractal Generation**: Efficient computation of the Mandelbrot set using Rust and the `num-complex` crate
- **Interactive UI**: Pan, zoom, and adjust parameters in real-time
- **Responsive Design**: Works on various screen sizes
- **Beautiful Visualization**: Colorful rendering of the fractal with smooth gradients

## Project Structure

- `wasm-module/`: Rust code that compiles to WebAssembly
  - Uses `wasm-bindgen` for JavaScript interop
  - Implements the Mandelbrot set algorithm with the `num-complex` crate
- `frontend/`: React/TypeScript frontend
  - Vite-based build system
  - Canvas-based rendering of the fractal
  - Interactive controls for exploration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (https://rustup.rs/)
- wasm-pack (https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)
- Node.js and npm (https://nodejs.org/)

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the WebAssembly module:
   ```
   cd wasm-module
   wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir ../frontend/src/pkg
   ```
3. Run the frontend:
   ```
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your browser at the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173)

### Development Workflow

The project is set up with a convenient development workflow:

- Run `npm run dev` in the frontend directory to start the development server
- This will automatically watch for changes in the Rust code and rebuild the WebAssembly module

## How to Use

- **Pan**: Click and drag to move around the fractal
- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out
- **Iterations**: Adjust the slider to change the maximum number of iterations (affects detail level)
- **Reset**: Click the "Reset View" button to return to the initial view

## Implementation Details

### Rust Implementation

The Mandelbrot set is generated by iterating the function `z = zÂ² + c` for each point in the complex plane. The `num-complex` crate is used for complex number operations, making the code clean and efficient.

### WebAssembly Integration

The Rust code is exposed to JavaScript using `wasm-bindgen`, which handles the marshaling of data between the two languages. The pixel data is returned as a `Vec<u8>` and converted to an `ImageData` object in JavaScript.

### React Frontend

The React frontend provides an intuitive user interface for exploring the fractal. It uses the Canvas API to render the pixel data from WebAssembly and provides controls for adjusting parameters.

## Performance Considerations

- The fractal generation is CPU-intensive, especially at higher resolutions and iteration counts
- WebAssembly provides near-native performance for the computation
- For very large canvases or high iteration counts, there might be a noticeable delay in rendering
